Create a complete, single-page portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website should be fully responsive and designed with a futuristic, minimalist, black-and-white theme.

Theme & Style:

Color Palette: Strictly black and white. Use black as the background (#000000) and white (#FFFFFF) for text and accents.

Typography: Use the 'Inter' font from Google Fonts. Headings should be bold and larger, while body text should be clean and readable.

Layout: A modern, clean, single-page layout with smooth scrolling between sections. Use generous white space and a clear visual hierarchy.

Futuristic Elements: Incorporate subtle animations on scroll, hover effects on links and buttons, and a simple, clean loading animation. Avoid anything too flashy.

Website Structure & Content:
Please use the information from this LinkedIn profile to populate the content: https://www.linkedin.com/in/laksshmi-narayanan-p

Navigation Bar: A fixed navigation bar at the top with links that smoothly scroll to the following sections: Home, About, Experience, Projects, Contact.

Hero Section (Home):

A full-screen section.

Main Heading: "Laksshmi Narayanan P"

Subheading: [Your professional title from LinkedIn, e.g., "Software Engineer" or "Aspiring Developer"]

A call-to-action button that says "View My Work" and scrolls to the Projects section.

About Section:

A brief, engaging summary. Use the "About" section from the LinkedIn profile as the source text.

Experience Section:

Display work experience in a clean, vertical timeline format.

For each job, include: Job Title, Company Name, and Dates of Employment.

Projects Section:

A grid or card-based layout to showcase 3-4 of your best projects.

If projects aren't listed on LinkedIn, create placeholder project cards with:

Project Name (e.g., "Project Alpha," "Project Beta")

A brief description (2-3 sentences).

Links for "Live Demo" and "GitHub" (use # for the links).

Contact Section:

A simple and direct way for people to connect.

Include clickable icons/links for:

LinkedIn (use the provided URL)

GitHub (use a placeholder URL like https://github.com/your-username)

Email (use a placeholder like mailto:your-email@example.com)

Technical Requirements:

Create three separate files: index.html, style.css, and script.js.

Ensure the code is well-commented.

The final website must be fully responsive and function perfectly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
